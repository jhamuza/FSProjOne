<p style="font-size: x-large; color: black;">Floods are identified as <b>the most devastating hazards in the world</b> (Prăvălie and Costache, 2013; Mishra and Sinha, 2020; Sarkar and Mondal, 2020). Flood often causes severe loss of human lives and socio-economic damage (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Costache, 2019). The public in <b>Sarawak has been urged to make essential preparations for potential floods and landslides</b>, according to a news article published on December 23, 2021 by The Borneo Post, following the worst flood events in decades caused by three days of torrential rain in Klang Valley and Pahang. Based on another infographic released by MetMalaysia on December 22, 2021, a monsoon surge is forecast from December 27 to December 29, 2021, with constant rain in the western half of Sarawak and eastern Sabah during that time, adding to the concern.</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large; color: black">In our first Mini Project for Applied Data Science with Forward School, we analysed several data sets provided by <b>Public Info Banjir</b> and the <b>Department of Irrigation and Drainage</b> on the occurrence of floods and their average height in Sarawak, as well as to share the documentation involved from data scraping, cleaning, analyzing and visualization.</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large; color: black">This is followed by a discussion centred on the aforementioned graphs and how the approaching rainy season will effect certain areas of Sarawak, as well as how the data may be used to assist both the government and the general population in mitigating the flood's impact.</p>
